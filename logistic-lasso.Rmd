Goal: Build a logistic-LASSO model to select features, and impletement the pathwise coordinatewise optimization algorithm to obtain a path of solutions with a sequence of descending λ’s.

## Standardize the data for the regularization

```{r data, message = FALSE }
library(tidyverse)

standardize = function(col) {
  mean = mean(col)
  stdev = sd(col)
  return((col - mean)/stdev)
}

# just standardize the covariates
standardized.data = read.csv(file = "breast-cancer-1.csv") %>% 
  select(radius_mean:fractal_dimension_worst) %>% 
  map_df(.x = ., standardize)

# add back in the response and ids
data = cbind(read.csv(file = "breast-cancer-1.csv") %>% select(id:diagnosis), 
             standardized.data) %>% 
  mutate(diagnosis = factor(diagnosis, levels = c("B", "M")))
```

```{r}
colnames(cancer)
```
